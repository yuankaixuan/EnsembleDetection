The data is structured as follows. Each event has a directory, with two subfolders, rumours and non-rumours. These two folders have folders named with a tweet ID. The tweet itself can be found on the 'source-tweet' directory of the tweet in question, and the directory 'reactions' has the set of tweets responding to that source tweet.

This dataset was used in the paper 'Learning Reporting Dynamics during Breaking News for Rumour Detection in Social Media' for rumour detection. For more details, please refer to the paper.
